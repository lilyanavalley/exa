With the hope of making an inspirational change-driven narrative game, *Project EXA* is free and open-source software.
The [GPL License](./LICENSE.md) grants you this freedom, and I (the developer) hope you'll find some usefulness in
releasing this software to the public as both a playable experience and a learning opportunity. Contributions are
welcomed and warmly encouraged! ☺️
